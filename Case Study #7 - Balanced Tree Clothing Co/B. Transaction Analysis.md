## B. Transaction Analysis
### 1. How many unique transactions were there?
```TSQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM sales;
```
| unique_transactions  |
|----------------------|
| 2500                 |

---
### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
```TSQL
SELECT AVG(product_count) AS avg_unique_products
FROM (
  SELECT 
    txn_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS product_count
  FROM sales 
  GROUP BY txn_id
) temp;
```
| avg_unique_products  |
|----------------------|
| 6                    |

---
### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
```TSQL
WITH transaction_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    txn_id,
    SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY txn_id)

SELECT 
  DISTINCT 
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS pct_25th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS pct_50th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS pct_75th
FROM transaction_revenue;
```
| pct_25th | pct_50th | pct_75th  |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 375.75   | 509.5    | 647       |

---
### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?
```TSQL
SELECT CAST(AVG(total_discount) AS decimal(5, 1)) AS avg_discount_per_transaction
FROM (
  SELECT 
    txn_id,
    SUM(qty*price*discount/100.0) AS total_discount
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY txn_id
) temp;
```
| avg_discount_per_transaction  |
|-------------------------------|
| 62.5                          |

---
### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  CAST(100.0*COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN member = 1 THEN txn_id END) 
		/ COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS FLOAT) AS members_pct,
  CAST(100.0*COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN member = 0 THEN txn_id END)
		/ COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS FLOAT) AS non_members_pct
FROM sales;
```
| members_pct | non_members_pct  |
|---------|--------------|
| 60.2    | 39.8         |

---
### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
```TSQL
WITH member_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    member,
    txn_id,
    SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY member, txn_id
) 

SELECT 
  member,
  CAST(AVG(1.0*revenue) AS decimal(10,2)) AS avg_revenue
FROM member_revenue
GROUP BY member;
```
| member | avg_revenue  |
|--------|--------------|
| 0      | 515.04       |
| 1      | 516.27       |
