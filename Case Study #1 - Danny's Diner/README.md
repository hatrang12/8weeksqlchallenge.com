## üõ†Ô∏è Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## ‚ùì Case Study Questions
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, 
  not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

### Q9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
Note: Only customers who are members receive points when purchasing items
```TSQL
WITH CustomerPoints AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN s.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM members) AND mn.product_name = 'sushi' THEN mn.price*20
      WHEN s.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM members) AND mn.product_name != 'sushi' THEN mn.price*10 
    ELSE 0 END AS points
  FROM menu mn 
  JOIN sales s
    ON mn.product_id = s.product_id
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM CustomerPoints
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Q10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```TSQL
WITH programDates AS (

    customer_id, 
    join_date,
    DATEADD(d, 6, join_date) AS valid_date, 
    EOMONTH('2021-01-01') AS last_date
  FROM members
)

SELECT 
  p.customer_id,
  SUM(CASE 
      	WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN p.join_date AND p.valid_date THEN m.price*20
      	WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price*20
      ELSE m.price*10 END) AS total_points
FROM sales s
JOIN programDates p 
  ON s.customer_id = p.customer_id
