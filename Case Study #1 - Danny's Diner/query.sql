-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

SELECT 
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(m.price) AS total_pay
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id

ORDER BY s.customer_id;


-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM sales 
GROUP BY customer_id;


-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

WITH orderRank AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    order_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rnk
  FROM sales

FROM orderRank o
JOIN menu m 
  ON o.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE o.rnk = 1
GROUP BY o.customer_id, o.order_date, m.product_name;


-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

  COUNT(*) AS most_purch
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m

  ON s.product_id = mn.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;


-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
-- Note: Only customers who are members receive points when purchasing items

WITH CustomerPoints AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN s.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM members) AND mn.product_name = 'sushi' THEN mn.price*20

)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM CustomerPoints
GROUP BY customer_id;


-- 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points
-- on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

WITH programDates AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    join_date,
    DATEADD(d, 6, join_date) AS valid_date, 
    EOMONTH('2021-01-01') AS last_date
  FROM members
)

SELECT 
  p.customer_id,
  SUM(CASE 
      	WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN p.join_date AND p.valid_date THEN m.price*20
      	WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price*20
      ELSE m.price*10 END) AS total_points

JOIN programDates p 
  ON s.customer_id = p.customer_id
JOIN menu m
