# üçï Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
## D. Pricing and Ratings
### Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```TSQL
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10 END) AS money_earned
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;
```
| money_earned  |
|---------------|
| 138           |

---
### Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
* Add cheese is $1 extra
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138 	-- @basecost = result of the previous question

SELECT 
  @basecost + SUM(CASE WHEN p.topping_name = 'Cheese' THEN 2
		  ELSE 1 END) updated_money
FROM #extrasBreak e
JOIN pizza_toppings p
  ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id;
```
| updated_money  |
|----------------|
| 145            |

### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ratings
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  order_id INT,
  rating INT);
INSERT INTO ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,3),
  (2,5),
  (3,3),
  (4,1),
  (5,5),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,3);

 SELECT *
 FROM ratings;
 ```
| order_id | rating  |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | 3       |
| 2        | 5       |
| 3        | 3       |
| 4        | 1       |
| 5        | 5       |
| 7        | 3       |
| 8        | 4       |
| 10       | 3       |

### Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
* ```customer_id```
* ```order_id```
* ```runner_id```
* ```rating```
* ```order_time```
* ```pickup_time```
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

```TSQL
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  c.order_id,
  r.runner_id,
  c.order_time,
  r.pickup_time,
  DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS mins_difference,
  r.duration,
  ROUND(AVG(r.distance/r.duration*60), 1) AS avg_speed,
  COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
GROUP BY 
  c.customer_id,
  c.order_id,
  r.runner_id,
  c.order_time,
  r.pickup_time, 
  r.duration;
  ```
| customer_id | order_id | runner_id | order_time              | pickup_time             | mins_difference | duration | avg_speed | pizza_count  |

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138

SELECT 
  @basecost AS revenue,
  SUM(distance)*0.3 AS runner_paid,
  @basecost - SUM(distance)*0.3 AS money_left
FROM #runner_orders_temp;
```
| revenue | runner_paid | money_left  |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 138     | 43.56       | 94.44       |
