# üçä Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments
## D. Index Analysis
The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segments‚Äô clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the `composition` column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
```TSQL
WITH avg_composition_rank AS (
  SELECT 
    metrics.interest_id,
    map.interest_name,
    metrics.month_year,
    ROUND(metrics.composition / metrics.index_value, 2) AS avg_composition,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY metrics.month_year ORDER BY metrics.composition / metrics.index_value DESC) AS rnk
  FROM interest_metrics metrics
  JOIN interest_map map 
    ON metrics.interest_id = map.id
  WHERE metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
) 
SELECT *
FROM avg_composition_rank
--filter top 10 interests for each month
WHERE rnk <= 10; 
```
140 rows for 14 months in total. The first 10 rows:

| interest_id | interest_name                 | month_year | avg_composition | rnk  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------|
| 6324        | Las Vegas Trip Planners       | 2018-07-01 | 7.36            | 1    |
| 6284        | Gym Equipment Owners          | 2018-07-01 | 6.94            | 2    |
| 4898        | Cosmetics and Beauty Shoppers | 2018-07-01 | 6.78            | 3    |
| 77          | Luxury Retail Shoppers        | 2018-07-01 | 6.61            | 4    |
| 39          | Furniture Shoppers            | 2018-07-01 | 6.51            | 5    |
| 18619       | Asian Food Enthusiasts        | 2018-07-01 | 6.1             | 6    |
| 6208        | Recently Retired Individuals  | 2018-07-01 | 5.72            | 7    |
| 21060       | Family Adventures Travelers   | 2018-07-01 | 4.85            | 8    |
| 21057       | Work Comes First Travelers    | 2018-07-01 | 4.8             | 9    |
| 82          | HDTV Researchers              | 2018-07-01 | 4.71            | 10   |

### 2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
```TSQL
WITH avg_composition_rank AS (
  SELECT 
    metrics.interest_id,
    map.interest_name,
    metrics.month_year,
    ROUND(metrics.composition / metrics.index_value, 2) AS avg_composition,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY metrics.month_year ORDER BY metrics.composition / metrics.index_value DESC) AS rnk
  FROM interest_metrics metrics
  JOIN interest_map map 
    ON metrics.interest_id = map.id
  WHERE metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
),
frequent_interests AS (
  SELECT 
    interest_id,
    interest_name,
    COUNT(*) AS freq
  FROM avg_composition_rank
  WHERE rnk <= 10	--filter top 10 interests for each month
  GROUP BY interest_id, interest_name
)

SELECT * 
FROM frequent_interests
WHERE freq IN (SELECT MAX(freq) FROM frequent_interests);
```
| interest_id | interest_name            | freq  |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------|
| 7541        | Alabama Trip Planners    | 10    |
| 5969        | Luxury Bedding Shoppers  | 10    |
| 6065        | Solar Energy Researchers | 10    |

### 3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
```TSQL
WITH avg_composition_rank AS (
  SELECT 
    metrics.interest_id,
    map.interest_name,
    metrics.month_year,
    ROUND(metrics.composition / metrics.index_value, 2) AS avg_composition,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY metrics.month_year ORDER BY metrics.composition / metrics.index_value DESC) AS rnk
  FROM interest_metrics metrics
  JOIN interest_map map 
    ON metrics.interest_id = map.id
  WHERE metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT 
  month_year,
  AVG(avg_composition) AS avg_of_avg_composition
FROM avg_composition_rank
WHERE rnk <= 10 --filter top 10 interests for each month
GROUP BY month_year;
```
| month_year | avg_of_avg_composition  |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 2018-07-01 | 6.038                   |

This is my approach:
* Create a CTE `avg_compositions` to calculate the average composition value and the maximum of the average composition value for each `month_year`. In this case, I use the window function `MAX() OVER` to keep the corresponding `interest_id` and `month_year`.
* From the CTE `avg_compositions` above, create a new CTE `max_avg_compositions` to filter `interest_id` that has the average composition value equal to the maximum of the average composition value for each `month_year`.
* Next, from the CTE `max_avg_compositions`, JOIN with the table `interest_map` to take out relevant `interest_name` and create 2 last columns.
* To create the 3-month moving averages column, use the window function `AVG() OVER` with  `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
* To create the last 2 column, use `LAG() OVER`. Remember to specify the second argument in `LAG()` for `2_month_ago` column. Then, cast those moving values to string to concatenate with the corresponding `interest_name`. 
* Finally, filter rows that have `month_year` from September 2018 to August 2019.

```TSQL
WITH avg_compositions AS (
  SELECT 
    month_year,
    interest_id,
    ROUND(composition / index_value, 2) AS avg_comp,
    ROUND(MAX(composition / index_value) OVER(PARTITION BY month_year), 2) AS max_avg_comp
  FROM interest_metrics
  WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
),
max_avg_compositions AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM avg_compositions
  WHERE avg_comp = max_avg_comp
),
moving_avg_compositions AS (
  SELECT 
    mac.month_year,
    im.interest_name,
    mac.max_avg_comp AS max_index_composition,
    ROUND(AVG(mac.max_avg_comp) 
	  OVER(ORDER BY mac.month_year 
	       ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS '3_month_moving_avg',
    LAG(im.interest_name) OVER (ORDER BY mac.month_year) + ': ' +
	CAST(LAG(mac.max_avg_comp) OVER (ORDER BY mac.month_year) AS VARCHAR(4)) AS '1_month_ago',
    LAG(im.interest_name, 2) OVER (ORDER BY mac.month_year) + ': ' +
	CAST(LAG(mac.max_avg_comp, 2) OVER (ORDER BY mac.month_year) AS VARCHAR(4)) AS '2_month_ago'
  FROM max_avg_compositions mac 
  JOIN interest_map im 
    ON mac.interest_id = im.id
)

SELECT *
FROM moving_avg_compositions
WHERE month_year BETWEEN '2018-09-01' AND '2019-08-01';

### 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

The max average composition decreased overtime because top interests were mostly travel-related services, which were in high seasonal demands for some months throughout a year. Customers wanted to go on a trip during the last and first 3 months of a year. You can see `max_index_composition` were high from September 2018 to March 2019. 

This also means that Fresh Segments's business heavily relied on travel-related services. Other products and services didn't receive much interest from customers.
