# ðŸ›’ Case Study #5 - Data Mart
## A. Data Cleaning Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the ```data_mart``` schema named ```clean_weekly_sales```:
  * Convert the ```week_date``` to a ```DATE``` format
  * Add a ```week_number``` as the second column for each ```week_date``` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
  * Add a ```month_number``` with the calendar month for each ```week_date``` value as the 3rd column
  * Add a ```calendar_year``` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
  * Add a new column called ```age_band``` after the original ```segment``` column using the following mapping on the number inside the ```segment``` value

| egment | age_band     |
|--------|--------------|
| 1      | Young Adults |
| 2      | Middle Aged  |
| 3 or 4 | Retirees     |
  
  * Add a new ```demographic``` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the ```segment``` values
  
| segment | demographic |
|---------|-------------|
| C       | Couples     |
| F       | Families    |
  
  * Ensure all ```null``` string values with an ```"unknown"``` string value in the original ```segment``` column as well as the new ```age_band``` and ```demographic``` columns
  * Generate a new ```avg_transaction``` column as the sales value divided by ```transactions``` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
