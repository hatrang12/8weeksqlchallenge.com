FROM nextPlan
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' 
  AND next_plan = 'churn';
```

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```TSQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
),
annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
)

SELECT 
  AVG(CAST(DATEDIFF(d, trial_date, annual_date) AS FLOAT)) AS avg_days_to_annual
FROM trialPlan t
JOIN annualPlan a 
ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
```
| avg_days_to_annual  |
|---------------------|
| 104.62015503876     |

On average, it takes 105 days for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi.

---
### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)?
To solve this question: 
* Utilize 2 CTEs in the previous question: ```trialPlan``` and ```annualPlan``` to calculate the number of days between ```trial_date``` and ```annual_date```, then put that to new CTE named ```datesDiff```
* Create a recursive CTE named ```daysRecursion``` to generate 30-day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
* Left join from ```daysRecursion``` to ```datesDiff``` 
    
```TSQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
),
annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
),
datesDiff AS (
  SELECT 
    t.customer_id,
    DATEDIFF(d, trial_date, annual_date) AS diff
  FROM trialPlan t
  JOIN annualPlan a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id
),
daysRecursion AS (
  SELECT 
    0 AS start_period, 
    30 AS end_period
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    end_period + 1 AS start_period,
    end_period + 30 AS end_period
  FROM daysRecursion
  WHERE end_period < 360
)

SELECT 
  dr.start_period,
  dr.end_period,
  COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM daysRecursion dr
LEFT JOIN datesDiff dd 
  ON (dd.diff >= dr.start_period AND dd.diff <= dr.end_period)
GROUP BY dr.start_period, dr.end_period;
```
| start_period | end_period | customer_count  |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0            | 30         | 49              |
| 31           | 60         | 24              |
| 61           | 90         | 34              |
| 91           | 120        | 35              |
| 121          | 150        | 42              |
| 151          | 180        | 36              |
| 181          | 210        | 26              |
| 211          | 240        | 4               |
| 241          | 270        | 5               |
| 271          | 300        | 1               |
| 301          | 330        | 1               |
| 331          | 360        | 1               |

### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
```TSQL
WITH nextPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date,
    p.plan_name,
    LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY p.plan_id) AS next_plan
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS pro_to_basic_monthly
FROM nextPlan
WHERE plan_name = 'pro monthly'
  AND next_plan = 'basic monthly'
  AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;
```
| pro_to_basic_monthly|
|---------------------|
| 0                   |

There were no customers downgrading from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020.
