# ðŸ¥‘ Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
## D. Outside The Box Questions
### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
- I choose the year of 2020 to analyze because I already created the ```payments``` table in part C.
- If you want to incorporate the data in 2021 to see the whole picture (quarterly, 2020-2021 comparison, etc.), 
create a new ```payments``` table and change all the date conditions in part C to '2021-12-31'

```TSQL
WITH monthlyRevenue AS (
  SELECT 
    MONTH(payment_date) AS months,
    SUM(amount) AS revenue
  FROM payments
  GROUP BY MONTH(payment_date)
)

SELECT 
  months,
  revenue,
  (revenue-LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY months))/revenue AS revenue_growth
FROM monthlyRevenue;
```
| months | revenue  | revenue_growth  |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1      | 1282.00  | NULL            |
| 2      | 2792.60  | 0.540929        |
| 3      | 4342.40  | 0.356899        |
| 4      | 5972.70  | 0.272958        |
| 5      | 7324.10  | 0.184514        |
| 6      | 8765.50  | 0.164440        |
| 7      | 10207.50 | 0.141268        |
| 8      | 12047.40 | 0.152721        |
| 9      | 12913.20 | 0.067047        |
| 10     | 14952.50 | 0.136385        |
| 11     | 12862.70 | -0.162469       |
| 12     | 13429.50 | 0.042205        |

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
- Monthly revenue growth: How does Foodie-Fi's revenue increase or decrease by monthly? Are there any months that the number of customers increasing significantly?
- Customers growth: How many customers increase by monthly? How does the rate look like (x1.5, x2,... after each month)? 
- Conversion rate: How many customers keep using Foodie-Fi after trial? How does the rate look like (x1.5, x2,...after each month)?
- Churn rate: How many customers cancel the subscription by monthly? What plan they has used?

### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
- Customers who downgraded their plan
- Customers who upgraded from basic monthly to pro monthly or pro annual
- Customers who cancelled the subscription

### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
- What is the primary reason for the cancellation? 
  + Price
  + Techinical issues
  + Customer support
  + Found an alternative
  + Others (please specify)
- Overall, how satisfied were you with the subscription? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)
- Would you consider using our services in the future? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)
- Would you recommend our company to a colleague, friend or family member? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)

### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
- From the exit survey, look for the most common reasons why customers cancelled the subscription
  + Price: increase the number of discounts in some seasons of a year, extend the trial time, or add more benefits to customers 
  + Service quality: work with the relevant department to fix the issue
  + Found an alternative: do some competitor analysis to see their competitive advantages over us
- To validate the effectiveness of those ideas, check:
  + Churn rate
  + Conversion rate
