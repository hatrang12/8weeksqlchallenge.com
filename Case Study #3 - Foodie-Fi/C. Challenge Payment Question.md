# ðŸ¥‘ Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
## C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
  * monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
  * upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
  * upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
  * once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | payment_date | amount | payment_order  |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08   | 9.90   | 1              |

  * Use a recursive CTE to increment rows for all monthly paid plans in 2020 until customers changing their plans, except 'pro annual'.
    * use ```CASE``` to create a new column ```last_date```: last day of the current plan
    * if a customer kept using the current plan, last_date = '2020-12-31'
    * if a customer changed the plan, last_date = (month difference between start_date and changing date) + start_date
  * Create a new table ```payments``` by selecting the required columns
